            <div class="container">
                <p>Hello, I'm Amimul Arnab. As a first-generation immigrant from Bangladesh, my passion lies in solving problems and bringing innovative ideas to life. My ultimate goal is to develop applications that not only address real-world issues but also make a meaningful impact on people's lives, all while earning a living. I'm currently advancing in two key areas: one as a sales consultant, and the other as a developer creating purpose-driven applications. Whether I'm helping homeowners transition to renewable energy and save money, or building real-time applications that tackle specific problems, my mission is to assist others with one act of kindness at a time.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">💻 Software</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <p>My journey into software development began during my sophomore year in high school when I built a simple snake game using Scratch. Sharing the game with my classmates and competing for the highest score revealed the joy and connection that software could create. This experience ignited my passion for software development and led me to pursue Computer Science at The Grove School of Engineering.</p>
                <p>Technology is always growing and there are always new problems to solve with endless ideas to explore. My skills are primarily focused on creating websites and web applications, but I also have a huge interest in entering mobile applications market, which provides a powerful way to connect millions of users in real time. As a gamer, video game development is a hobby of mine that combines creativity and problem-solving. I love challenges that require creative thinking and technical abilities.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">💼 Sales</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Regardless of the industry you’re in, the ability to market oneself is extremely important in any field. You can have a fantastic product, but without the ability to present it effectively and convey your excitement, it might go unnoticed. I realized the importance of marketing myself as a professional and trustworthy individual who isn’t afraid to seize opportunities in front of me.</p>
                <p>As an introvert, I struggled with social interactions, constantly avoiding conversations unless initiated by others. Realizing that I needed to take the initiative, I tackled my social anxiety head-on by taking a commission-based sales job selling solar going door-to-door—an introvert's worst nightmare. Despite facing rejection and embarrassment door after door, I persevered and eventually developed my communication and leadership skills. This experience taught me that effective self-marketing opens endless opportunities and that you're always one conversation away from changing your life.</p>
